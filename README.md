# Arcade Game Project

## Introduction

This project formed out of the [Udacity](https://udacity.com/) [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). It displays an arcade "Frogger" game.


## How to run

This game only functions in case a keyboard is attached to the device!

The game can be run direclty in the computer's browser. It is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
Please check [this](https://dehnerson.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/) to run the game.


## How to play

Once the page is loaded the game starts right away.

You will see a field of tiles made of grass, stone and water.
The goal is to help 5 friends to cross the stone-zone in order to reach the refreshing water-zone.
Each friend has to go one by one as the path is dangerous. You can help them navigating by clicking the direction keys on your keyboard.

The grass-zone each player will start in is save.
But in the stone-zone hostile bugs will be crawling across the field horizontally.
In case a bug hits a friend he goes back the grass-zone in order to recover. All of his friends, including the ones who already crossed the field, will assist him. This means, all 5 friends have to pass the stone-zone again.

As soon as the fifth friend arrives in the water-zone it is time to celebrate!
The game is won.

As an idicator on how effective your help was, the time you needed to so will be displayed.
